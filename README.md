This repository is for UW-Madison master program of data science course code. The folder's names are the course names. I have taken more theory courses wihtout coding requirement, which this repository does not include. I will provide a guideline on some of the courses. Due to COVID-19, I took some courses online. Still, I want to contribute my professors, teammates during the most difficult time.

STAT349 deals with time series data. In the Midterm and Final, I finished a continuous project on stock prices.

In course STAT421, Professor Derek Bean provided three generalized linear model, which is under Homework 7 folder.

In course STAT479, Professor Wei-Yin Loh introduced a new software GUIDE (https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~loh/guide.html) to perform machine learning.

In course STAT601, the first 24-hour project was collaborated with Tianrun Wang, who is now a Ph.D. candidate in University of Iowa.

For project in STAT605, we worked as a group including Hao Tong(htong25@wisc.edu), Junxia Zhao(jzhao347@wisc.edu), Jiayi Shen(jshen226@wisc.edu). The gitExample/ is my first time to use GitHub. Zihang Wang(zwang2547@wisc.edu) and I created names.txt to get familiar with git commands.

Course STAT628 consists of 3 modules, all of them are group projects. During Module3, I got COVID-19, because of that, code part was done by my other two teammates, Zhihao Zhao and Haoran Teng. My part was created presentation and wrote reports.  

I am really appreciated what I have learnt in UW-Madison, and thank you all for whom have helped and supported me!
